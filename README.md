# sfmlbox2d
game mechanics testbed

Very rough implementation of a 2d level editor with a control scheme that basically only I can understand at this point :p
Accompanying the level editor, a game that utilizes the worlds built within the level editor.

I will reimplement this and try to properly integrate SFML with Windows libraries.

On a positive note, not too bad with the game project, incorperating Box2D physics libraries with SFML.
I will be stepping through these for documentation which should familiarize myself with this again and continue.
